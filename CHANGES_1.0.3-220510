Changes with v1.0.3-220510

*) Digital Signature Extraction
- When malware detected, scanner scan it's file format.
- If file has digital signature(code signing), get the certificate information and write to the log and try to extract certificates to logs directory 
- If finished, you can see certficates in the log directory.export-certificate file format is DER.

*) Code improvement
- I improved the code, but it doesn't look clearer than the previous.
